# libbecquerel
A C++ brlyt/brlan library. As the implementation is heavily based on Switch Toolbox's implementation of these formats, this is licensed under GPLv3.

As of present, it is the developer's responsibility to maintain the material/font/texture indices when adding/removing materials/fonts/textures, but this may be subject to change at a later time.

CMake should be used to build this library.
